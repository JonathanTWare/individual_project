    "### Objective\n",
    "To achieve accurate predictions, I will develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques. I will explore different algorithms suitable for time series forecasting. Additionally, regression models like linear regression may be used to estimate crime counts based on the selected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target \n",
    "There are 3 Targets to this project. 'ASSAULT', 'BATTERY', and 'CRIMINAL DAMAGE'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Need to haves (Deliverables):\n",
    "- Need to explore the data.\n",
    "- run autocorrelation visualizations\n",
    "- Select features for modeling\n",
    "- Run features through atleast 5 different algorythms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nice to haves (With more time):\n",
    "Further feature exploration to see if model prediction can increase. Look for data to add to the TSA such as population and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a name=\"findings\"></a>Key Findings:\n",
    "- Assault had a week correlation with time\n",
    "- Battery had a weak correlation with time\n",
    "- Criminal Damages, although there. also had a weak correlation\n",
    "- using 10 crime types, only 3 made the cut for modeling\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The best model for ASSAULT (Simple Exponential Smoothing RMSE 9.84) did beat baseline(Moving Average Baseline RMSE 9.86), and when running it through a test score it obtained a 9.94 RMSE which failed to beat baseline.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Based on the information provided, it seems that the Moving Avg Baseline did better in modeling overall.\n",
    "#### \n",
    "#### For the 10 crimes that went through autocorrelation, only 3 of them showed any correlation and still were not as predictable as baseline\n",
    "#### Considering all models, as none beat baseline, Further exploring and feature engineering maybe needed in order to predict crimes using time. It may be that time does not influence crime type count daily.\n",
